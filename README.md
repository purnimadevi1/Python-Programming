# Covid 19 Project


## About  
A simulation project modelling the spread and impact of COVID-19.

##  Repository Contents  
- `app.py` — Main application script.  
- `assignment2.py` — Secondary simulation/analysis script.  
- `helper.py` — Utility functions used across modules.  
- `sim_parameters.py` — Configuration of simulation parameters.  
- `test.py` — Tests for validating simulation behavior.  
- `a2-countries.csv` — Dataset of countries used in simulations.  
- `a2-covid-simulated-timeseries.csv` — Generated simulation time-series data.  
- `a2-covid-summary-timeseries.csv` — Summary output of simulation runs.  
- `a2-covid-simulation.png` — Visual representation of simulation results.  
- `__pycache__/` — Python cache directory (auto-generated).

##  Key Features  
- Simulates COVID-19 spread across countries using real data as input.  
- Outputs detailed time-series of simulated cases and summaries.  
- Visualisation included to interpret simulation outcomes.  
- Configurable via `sim_parameters.py` allowing exploration of different scenarios.

##  Usage  
1. Edit `sim_parameters.py` to set simulation scenarios (countries, time-span, parameters).  
2. Run `app.py` to execute the simulation.  
3. Inspect `a2-covid-simulated-timeseries.csv` and `a2-covid-summary-timeseries.csv` for results.  
4. View `a2-covid-simulation.png` for a visual summary of the simulation run.
